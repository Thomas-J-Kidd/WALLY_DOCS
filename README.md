# WALLY_DOCS
by Thomas Kidd

**Note:** I personally use Obsidian as my Markdown editor. Its a cross platform "mind map" style editor that lets you connect documents together on the document itself. For example in Obsidian you will be able to click [[Research/InitialSetup/README|README]] as a link and it will let you jump to that link. Further there are some great plugins available in Obsidian. 

Canvas Plugin: This plugin lets you create flow chart diagrams. 

I highly recommend using Obsidian to navigate the tutorial for now. I am planning on creating a static web page that will help you run through the tutorial in your we browser but for now this is what I got.
